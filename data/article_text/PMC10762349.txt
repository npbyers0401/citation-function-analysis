A data catalogue of alcohol dehydrogenases in the genome of a tissue macerating Pectobacterium brasiliense isolated from potato in South Africa
Alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) catalyze the oxidation of alcohols and reduction of aldehydes and ketones. Primarily ADHs mitigate aldehydes and alcohol toxicity but they may also perform other functions. we listed all ADHs in the genome of strain BD163 of P. brasiliense submitted in www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. In total, 11 ADHs or alcohol dehydrogenase catalytic domain-containing proteins from the 4897858-length genome sequence of strain BD163 of P. brasiliense (GenBank JAKNTB000000000.1) were extracted, and when comparing with other strains, it was found that other P. brasiliense strains have similar or slightly different alcohol dehydrogenase capability. Still, other species had varying numbers of ADHs.Specifications Table

1 • Why are these data valuable? The data presented in this study hold significant value due to their ability to offer valuable insights into the various functions of alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in Pectobacterium brasiliense BD163. Consequently, this phenomenon enhances the understanding of the physiological mechanisms this bacterium shows that are not limited to its role in alcohol metabolism.• Who can benefit from these data? The data can significantly help various groups, including researchers investigating microbial pathogenesis, agricultural scientists, and biotechnologists. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the roles of ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) can facilitate the development of innovative control strategies targeting plant pathogens and provide valuable insights for drug design and biotechnological applications.• How can these data be reused by other researchers? Other researchers in the field potentially use the data presented in this study. Specifically, these data can be utilised to conduct comparative genomics, examine ADH's functions in various bacterial species, and investigate the pathways associated with ADH in relation to stress resistance, biofilm formation, and virulence.
2 The dataset focuses on alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) in Pectobacterium brasiliense strain BD163, a crop-pathogenic bacterium. ADHs play diverse roles beyond alcohol detoxification, including biofilm formation and virulence. Extracted from the genome (GenBank JAKNTB000000000.1), these genes shed light on P. brasiliense's physiology. Despite limited whole-genome analysis, this dataset contributes to understanding ADH functions. The structured dataset comprises genome sequences, ADH genes, and references to related studies. Insights into ADH capabilities could aid in controlling this pathogen, which is crucial given restricted antibiotic use against plant pathogens.

When compared with other bacteria, it was discovered that similarly, the 5111,375 bp genome of strain PCC1 of P. brasiliense (GenBank CP128509.1) deposited on www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov has nine dehydrogenase genes and therefore only slight differences in dehydrogenase activity can be expected from the two strains. Similarly, eight genes with alcohol dehydrogenase activity were sequenced in the genome of strain 21PCA_AGRO2 of P. brasiliense with GenBank ID CP113504.1 deposited on www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, indicating similar alcohol dehydrogenase activity between all three P. brasiliense strains, namely, BD163, PCC1 and 21PCA_AGRO2. In contract, Methylotenera mobilis strain JLW8 (Genbank CP001672.1) has three ADHs on its 2,547,570 bp complete genome sequence on www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and the 5021,812 bp complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli KO11FL (GenBank CP002970.1) had over 20 ADHs. These comparisons are summarized in Table 2.

The medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily of ADHs consists of enzymes with a domain, the catalytic domain, and another domain for binding NAD or NADP hence two of the listed genes on Table 1 are referred to as NAD(P)–dependent. The bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHE) contains two catalytic reaction domains responsible for the conversion of acetyl-coenzyme A to ethanol. The N-terminal acetaldehyde dehydrogenase domain is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA into acetaldehyde while the Cterminal of the alcohol dehydrogenase domain of the ADHE converts acetaldehyde to ethanol to complete the two-step process involving the two domains. S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase/class III alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes formaldehyde in a glutathione-dependent reaction and it is also involved in NO metabolism by catalyzing the reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione [2]. Iron-containing ADHs are widespread in bacteria [3]. Both the iron-containing and zinc-binding ADHs depend on iron and zinc to execute their functions. This curation of ADHs in P. brasiliense requires follow-up with phylogenetic analysis of ADHs across taxa and further work needs to be done to assess if ADHs cannot be exploited as targets of antibacterial agents to lessen the impact of P. brasiliense on crops.3 The genome sequence of strain BD163 of P. brasiliense, BioProject no. PRJNA798891, with raw reads under accession no. JAKNTB000000000, BioSample number SAMN25132833, and GenBank assembly accession number GCA_022172285.1 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was downloaded and individual ADH genes were searched using the normal search function. To create the ADH gene catalogue, the genes were listed with their characteristics namely, locus tag, protein accession number and annotation. A similar search for ADHs was done on other P. brasiliense strains and bacterial species and comparisons were made following these steps.
Data retrieval: The genome sequencing data for Pectobacterium brasiliense strain BD163 (GenBank accession: JAKNTB000000000.1) was retrieved from the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
The identification of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase: A BLAST analysis was conducted using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) to search for similarities between known alcohol dehydrogenase sequences and the genome of P. brasiliense BD163.
Functional annotation: The functional annotation of the ADH genes was conducted utilising appropriate bioinformatics tools to anticipate potential functions beyond the metabolism of alcohol.
Comparative analysis: In order to evaluate the conservation and divergence of the identified ADH genes in P. brasiliense BD163, a comparative analysis was performed by comparing them with ADH genes from other strains of P. brasiliense and closely related species.
Findings: The findings were displayed in tabular formats to emphasise ADH genes' existence and potential roles in P. brasiliense BD163.
Thus, this methodology provides a comprehensive description of the procedures employed to obtain, examine, and authenticate the ADH genes in P. brasiliense BD163, thereby ensuring the dependability and pertinence of the dataset.‘Not applicable’.The authors have read and follow the ethical requirements for publication in Data in Brief and confirms that the current work does not involve human subjects, animal experiments, or any data collected from social media platforms.Sarah Oluwatobi Otun: Data curation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.
